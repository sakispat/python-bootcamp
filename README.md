# Project

Is a command prompt (shell) application.  

We have an application where the user enters the items in the command line and 
displays them in a list at the end of each entry and at the end of the application 
displays the entire list of items.

Also, if you do not enter some information, a message is displayed, try again.

A message appears at the end of the program asking if you want to 
continue or stop the program.


```bash
    # run program
    python app.py
```
